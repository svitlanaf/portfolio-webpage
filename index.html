    <h1>This page is all about me</h1>
    <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="An image of Svitlana".height="300" width="300">
      <p>My name is Svitlana Filatova. Originally I'm from Ukraine. I speak 3 languages: Ukrainian, Russian and English.
I love to travel around the world and in the past 5 years I lived in the UK and in the US. I really enjoy life and like to
challenge myself. I live in Bellevue with my husband and 2 little kids and starting the programming course is a real challenge
for me at the moment, and I promiced myself to do my best to make my family proud of me and to become a bit more independent.</p>
      <p>I have a bachelor degree in Economics. I worked as a marketer for more than 7 years, but I didn't really enjoy my
job. That's why I decided to change my career and finished a QA Engeneer course. I was so happy to get a Junior QA position
in one of the most famous IT companies of Ukraine - Luxoft. I worked for one of the biggest Investment Banks and as a QA
Engeneer I was responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <ol>Preparation QA strategies, plans and reports.</ol>
          <ol>Participating in release process and QA signoffs.</ol>
          <ol>Participating in interviewing QA candidates and newcomers training.</ol>
        </ul>
      <p>I loved my job, but, sadly, I had to leave it because we moved to London with my husband. In the UK
I gave birth to both of my kids and that's actually why I have a 5 years gap in my career. But being a stay-at-home mom
doesn't mean that I didn't learn anything! As I had a test engeneer background I decided to learn more about programming.
I found an amazing programming course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org">coursera.org</a> -
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody.</a> I've learned Python Data Structures,
Python usage to Access Web Data, Database usage with Python, Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
(you can check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svitlana-filatova-3251b730">Linkedin profile</a> to find certificates
and some more information about my profeccional expirience).</p>
    <h2>My life</h2>
      <p>We traveled a lot with my family and traveling is my #1 interest. I love to descover new places and meet new
people, I really love nature and different cuisines. I love chocolade and ice-cream! Yup, I'm the biggest sweet tooth in the
world!</p>
      <p>Thanks to my friend Maria I've found out about Epicodus and decided - why not to try myself in programming! During the
first week I've learned a lot of new information about web programming, HTML, CSS, Github and Bootstrap. I worked on progects
in pair with few people and it was so fun! We've made some web pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/hello-world">Hello World</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/favorite-things">Our favorite things</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/cookie-recipe">Cookie recipe</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/cat-blog">Cat blog</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/our-first-web-page">Our First Webpage</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/shop">Cupkace shop</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/shelter">Pet shelter</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/vacation">Our vacation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/wiki">Wikipedia page</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here's some more information about projects.</p>
      <h3>Hello World</h3>
        <p>This project was the very first one, so there's not much in it. Using HTML we just practiced to write a bit of
          simple code with headers and list.</p>
      <h3>Our favorite things</h3>
        <p>Me and my pair did our best to describe our favorite things such as people we love and activies we enjoy. We used
HTML and added some images at the first time.</p>
      <h3>Cookie recipe</h3>
        <p>The next web page was about a cookie recipe with a list of ingredients, step-by-step directions how to make it and
a bit of history about how it was invented. We also used HTML to write this code.</p>
      <h3>Cat blog</h3>
      <p>The "Cat blog" web page is the best nonentity I've ever created!! This page is about cat named Pupsik, his kind
history, favorite things to do and favorite food, plus his amazing photos! We used HTML and CSS to create this page.</p>
