    <h1>This page is all about me!</h1>
      <p>My name is Svitlana Filatova. Originally I'm from Ukraine. I love to travel around the world and in the past 5 years
I lived in the UK and in the US. I really enjoy life and like to challenge myself. I live in Bellevue with my husband and 2
little kids and starting the programming course is a real challenge for me at the moment, and I promiced myself to do my best
to make my family proud of me and to become a bit more independent.</p>

      <h3>Hi, it's me!</h3>
      <p>Thanks to my friend Maria I've found out about Epicodus and decided - why not to try myself in programming! During the
first week I've learned a lot of new information about web programming, HTML, CSS, Github and Bootstrap. I worked on progects
in pair with few people and it was so fun! We've made some web pages:</p>
