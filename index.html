              <p class="header">My name is <strong>Svitlana Filatova</strong>. Originally I'm from Ukraine. I speak 3 languages: Ukrainian, Russian and English.
                I <strong>love</strong> to travel around the world and in the past 5 years I lived in the UK and in the US. I really enjoy life and like to
                challenge myself. I live in Bellevue with my husband and 2 little kids and starting the programming course is a real challenge
                for me at the moment, and I promiced myself to do my best to make my family proud of me and to become a bit more independent.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>I have a bachelor degree in Economics. I worked as a marketer for more than 7 years, but I didn't really
                enjoy my job. That's why I decided to change my career and finished a QA Engeneer course. I was so happy to get a Junior QA position
                in one of the most famous IT companies of Ukraine - Luxoft. I worked for one of the biggest Investment Banks.</p>
              <p><strong><em>As a QA Engeneer I was responsible for:</em></strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Preparation QA strategies, plans and reports.</li>
                <li>Participating in release process and QA signoffs.</li>
                <li>Participating in interviewing QA candidates and newcomers training.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>I loved my job, but, sadly, I had to leave it because we moved to London with my husband. In the UK
                I gave birth to both of my kids and that's actually why I have a 5 years gap in my career. But being a stay-at-home mom
                doesn't mean that I didn't learn anything!</p>
              <p>As I had a test engeneer background I decided to learn more about programming. I found an amazing
                programming course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org">coursera.org</a> - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">
                  Python for Everybody.</a> I've learned:
                <ul>
                  <li>Python Data Structures</li>
                  <li>Python usage to Access Web Data</li>
                  <li>Database usage with Python</li>
                  <li>Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python</li>
                </ul>

              <p class="block">Thanks to my friend Maria I've found out about Epicodus and decided - why not to try myself
                in programming. During the first week I've learned a lot of new information about web programming, HTML, CSS, Github and Bootstrap.
                I worked on progects in pair with few people and it was so fun! </p>

              <p>This project was the very first one, so there's not much in it. Using HTML we just practiced to write
                a bit of simple code with headers and list.</p>
              <h3><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/favorite-things">Our favorite things</a></h3>
              <p>Me and my pair did our best to describe our favorite things such as people we love and activies we enjoy.

              <h3><a href="https://github.com/svitlanaf/cookie-recipe">Cookie recipe</a></h3>
              <p>The next web page was about a cookie recipe with a list of ingredients, step-by-step directions how to
                make it and a bit of history about how it was invented. We also used HTML to write this code.</p>
